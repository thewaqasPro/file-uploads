# Uploader Component - Implementation Notes

## Solution Overview

This implementation addresses the key concerns about memory leaks and performance when displaying uploaded images.

## Key Features

### 1. **Smart Image Source Management**

- **Uploaded files**: Uses S3 URLs (no memory concerns)
- **Uploading files**: Uses object URLs with proper cleanup
- **Failed uploads**: Shows error state with object URL

### 2. **Memory Leak Prevention**

- Object URLs are created only when needed (not for uploaded files)
- Automatic cleanup with `useEffect` cleanup functions
- URLs are revoked when component unmounts or file changes

### 3. **Performance Optimization**

- `FileItem` component is memoized with `React.memo`
- Progress updates only re-render the specific file component
- Object URLs are only created for files that need them

### 4. **Visual States**

- **Uploading**: Progress indicator with dimmed image
- **Error**: Error icon overlay with red border
- **Success**: Clear image with delete button on hover
- **Deleting**: Loading spinner on delete button

## Environment Setup

Add this to your `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_BUCKET_URL=https://your-bucket-name.s3.your-region.amazonaws.com
```

## Performance Benefits

1. **Minimal Re-renders**: Only the specific file being updated re-renders
2. **Memory Efficient**: Object URLs are cleaned up automatically
3. **Network Efficient**: Uses S3 URLs for uploaded files (no local storage)
4. **Optimized UX**: Smooth transitions and hover states

## Technical Implementation

- Uses `useEffect` for object URL lifecycle management
- `React.memo` prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Conditional rendering based on upload state
- Proper TypeScript typing for all states
